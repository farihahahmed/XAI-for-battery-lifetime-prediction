# How to use instructions

**Load Data.ipynb** can be used to convert the raw data into usable file formats

**Regular files:** The files are formatted in the following way: **number of cells-train %-test %**. For instance, 100-50-50.ipynb means in this file, we tested 100 cells with 50-50 on train and test.

**Hyperparameter tuning files:** same files, but they begin with PARAMS.

Many here are experimental files, such as the files beginning with 'outliers' (we took out the outliers to see the impact on results).
